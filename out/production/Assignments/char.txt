Java - I want to read a file name from command line then use a bufferedreader to read each line

I'm getting an eclipse red underline error on the

 br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(inFile));

line on "inFile". This is the object that I would like to read which I believe contains the command line filename/path that I give it on the command line. Am I handling this wrong?

import java.io.File;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {

     public static void main(String[] args) {
      if (0 < args.length) {
          File inFile = new File(args[0]);
      }

        BufferedReader br = null;

        try {

            String sCurrentLine;

            br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(inFile));

            while ((sCurrentLine = br.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(sCurrentLine);
            }

        }

        catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        finally {
            try {
                if (br != null)br.close();
            } catch (IOException ex) {
                ex.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

Change this:

if (0 < args.length) {
    File inFile = new File(args[0]);
}

to this:

File inFile = null;
if (0 < args.length) {
   inFile = new File(args[0]);
} else {
   System.err.println("Invalid arguments count:" + args.length);
   System.exit();
}

because the file variable is not accessible outside the if/else statement.

I've added in the else (for the case when no args are provided) a friendly message saying the the argument count was invalid and exit for the program.

    So adding the else statement now gives a larger scope to inFile? Or you did that just to give the user better knowledge of the args error? – john stamos May 28 '13 at 22:05
    No, defining the inFile outside of the if/else statement gives larger scope (the scope is within the main method) – Konstantin Yovkov May 28 '13 at 22:08
    Perfect, thank you. I think you can take out the "File" inside the if statement now as you have already declared inFile as such outside the if, other than that I think that's good. – john stamos May 28 '13 at 23:17
    Correct, missed to fix that. Cheers! :) – Konstantin Yovkov May 28 '13 at 23:20

inFile is declared in the if statement. As such, it's scope ends at line 11;

Your variable, inFile, is local to the containing if-block.

Perhaps this:

 public static void main(String[] args) {
      File inFile = null;

      if (0 < args.length) {
          inFile = new File(args[0]);
      }

The variable inFile loses scope outside of the if block:

  if (0 < args.length) {
      File inFile = new File(args[0]);
  }

Change to:

  File inFile = null;
  if (0 < args.length) {
      inFile = new File(args[0]);
      // Make sure the file exists, can read, etc...
  }
  else
  {
    // Do something if a required parameter is not provided...
  }

    Note that one must take care as to scope and associated synchronization considerations of File variable in question. Limit to encapsulated method as best practice. – Darrell Teague Aug 13 '18 at 17:44

After the 'if' statement block, you could dump contents of "inFile" to a Scanner object.

Scanner scannedIn = new Scanner(inFile);

Then use the '.next' method to verify that you're accessing the file.

System.out.println(scannedIn.next());
